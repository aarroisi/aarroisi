Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently working as CTO at [Scalev](https://github.com/scalev-id). I mainly work with Elixir and Python, and a bit of JavaScript here and there.

My approach to tackling problems in software is to ruthlessly cut down complexity when possible. Software is all about trade-offs. In my 4+ years of experience as a founding engineer in some of the apps I maintain, I have found that complexity is a net negative overall. Sure, you need complexity when it is absolutely needed. But you'll be surprised that some of the "needed" complexity is, in fact, not needed and can be cut down if you deliberate on each decision. That's why I love Elixir, as it can get me so far without having to deal with lots of moving parts.

Apps I currently maintain:

Contact me if I you think I can help you in any way.
